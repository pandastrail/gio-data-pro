Originally from **Morelia, Mexico**, calling **Zürich Unterland, Switzerland** home, where I split my time between speaking with data and playing on bikes.

## Beyond the SQL and Bar Charts

I’m a certified **Swiss Cycling Guide** running [BikeFlow](https://www.bikeflow.ch/), where I teach kids and adults the joy of balance and movement on two wheels.

## My Data First Approach

Over the years, when tackling data projects, either to create a data product, a pipeline or BI-Layer, I have developed a simple  process that helps me kick-off the conversation.

``` mermaid
graph TD
A[Talk to me]
B[Show me the data!]
A --> |I'm your shadow for a day or two| B
C[Gio's 12-Question Value Survey]
D[Show me how is done]
B --> |Walk me through it please| D
C --> A
G{Do we have enough context?}
D --> G
F[Let's keep talking, and draft the concept together]
G --> |Yes| F
G --> |No| A

```
