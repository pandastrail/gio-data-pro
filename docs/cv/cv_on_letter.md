**Application for Head of Web Analytics**  
On AG  

Dear Hiring Team,

Over the past three years, I’ve been responsible for building and maintaining the entire web tracking and marketing data ecosystem at JobCloud — from tag management and attribution models to BI dashboards that inform strategic marketing decisions. This hands-on experience has shaped how I think about analytics: not as a collection of tools, but as an infrastructure that fuels creativity and business growth.

I’m now ready to bring that foundation into a leadership role, helping On evolve its digital measurement landscape. What excites me most about this position is the opportunity to connect On’s distinct storytelling and product excellence with data frameworks that amplify both. I believe great analytics is about empowerment — giving teams the clarity and confidence to experiment, test, and learn faster.

In my current role, I’ve:
- Led the design and implementation of JobCloud’s marketing attribution model, integrating data from 50+ sources.
- Managed the end-to-end tracking lifecycle — from event taxonomy to QA and BI visualization.
- Partnered with marketing, product, and engineering teams to define metrics that truly reflect user behavior.
- Mentored colleagues in tracking best practices, documentation, and data quality validation.

I’m at my best when building bridges between technical and creative people, transforming complex tracking systems into simple, usable insights. Joining On would mean continuing that journey in an environment that values curiosity, movement, and innovation — values that resonate deeply with me.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to discuss how my background in data engineering and analytics infrastructure can help shape the future of On’s web analytics vision.

Warm regards,  
**Giovanni López**
