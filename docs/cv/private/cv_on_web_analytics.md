## Personal Note

Curious by nature, builder by trade.  
I’ve spent my career connecting systems — from aircraft engines to marketing funnels — and people — from engineers to creatives.  
At On, I aim to turn that curiosity and technical precision into a shared analytics vision that empowers digital growth and experimentation culture.
