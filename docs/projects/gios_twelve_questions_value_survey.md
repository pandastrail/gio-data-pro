# Gio's 12-Question Value Survey

*A field guide for discovering the real shape of a data problem.*

---

## A Dozen carefully curated Ice-Breakers

### 1. **What are we trying to make better?**

Start with the improvement, not the tool. What’s the real outcome or behavior we want to see change?
→ *“Sell more bikes”, “reduce manual work”, “spot broken sensors faster”*.

---

### 2. **Who cares if it works?**

Identify the real users, not just the project owner. Who will use it, trust it, or complain if it fails?
→ Stakeholders, consumers, operators, or sometimes… you.

---

### 3. **How do they do this today?**

Reality check. Is there already an Excel, a script, or a ritual keeping the wheels turning?
→ Understanding the *current hack* tells you what really matters.

---

### 4. **What data already exists — and where does it live?**

Not “what data do we need,” but “what do we have hiding in plain sight?”
→ Databases, APIs, CSVs, telemetry, notebooks, sticky notes.

---

### 5. **How much do we trust that data?**

Every data story has a reliability subplot. Is it clean, consistent, complete — or suspiciously polite?
→ This tells you how much energy will go into cleaning vs. creating.

---

### 6. **What’s the smallest useful thing we could build?**

Imagine a v1 that already helps. Not perfect — just valuable enough to test.
→ This defines your *minimum lovable dataset or prototype*.

---

### 7. **How often does it need to stay fresh?**

Is this a live pulse, a daily update, or a quarterly postcard?
→ The answer drives architecture (batch, stream, event-driven).

---

### 8. **Who needs to talk to whom (systems included)?**

Data loves good conversations. Which apps, platforms, or people need to exchange info?
→ Think pipelines, APIs, cross-domain flows, governance boundaries.

---

### 9. **What decisions will this help someone make?**

Ground the value. What’s the button that someone presses differently because of this?
→ “Spend budget here,” “call the client,” “fix this anomaly.”

---

### 10. **What would success look like on a napkin?**

Draw it, describe it, or score it. What’s the quick visual that says “yep, it’s working”?
→ KPI, dashboard mock, alert, or simple before/after metric.

---

### 11. **What already works well that we shouldn’t break?**

Progress doesn’t always mean replacement. Sometimes it means respect.
→ Knowing the stable parts saves you from heroic re-engineering.

---

### 12. **If this were a living system, how would it evolve?**

Imagine future you, maintaining it. What could it learn, automate, or simplify over time?
→ Helps you design for adaptability instead of fragility.

---

## How to use it

* Ask all 12, then circle the 3 that sparked the most conversation — that’s the design focus.
* Adapt phrasing to the domain (marketing, operations, IoT, finance, etc.).
* Keep it fun. These questions are not a checklist — they’re conversation starters disguised as a framework.

### Optional framing

Label the four quadrants for quick orientation:

| Quadrant              | Questions | Focus                 |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | 1–3       | Why & who             |
| **Data Reality**      | 4–5       | What exists & quality |
| **Design & Flow**     | 6–8       | How it works          |
| **Value & Evolution** | 9–12      | Impact & future       |
