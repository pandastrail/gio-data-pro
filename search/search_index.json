After months of rejections on countless applications, I finally got the call, the kind that makes you phone your mother and say, \u201cMa, I\u2019m really an engineer now.\u201d GE wasn\u2019t just a job; it felt like a doorway into a bigger world.</p> <p>And then something even bigger happened: I was accepted into the EDISON Engineering Development Program, a rotating two-year journey through different departments. It promised growth, challenge, and the kind of exposure that young engineers dream of. I walked into the office feeling like I was stepping onto a launchpad.</p> <p>But the launchpad was steep.</p> <p>The weekly EDISON homework packs were dense, technical, sometimes cryptic: fluid mechanics, tolerances, material science, numerical methods, bolted joints, fracture mechanics. Just understanding the problem statements felt like its own assignment. This wasn\u2019t university anymore, this was a world where mistakes had consequences, where a forgotten parameter could ripple out into the safety of an aircraft engine.</p> <p>And then there was the senior engineer, blunt, harsh, relentless, who insisted in a truth I kind of sill carry today:</p> <p>\u201cFollow the process. Diligence isn\u2019t only about correctness. It protects you, and everyone else.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>That was the moment I realized engineering wasn\u2019t just math or CAD models. It was responsibility. Integrity. Rigor.</p> <p>Things shifted years later, during one of my assigments into Repair Engineering. Here, nothing was theoretical. If a fuel hose bracket had a 0.2 mm crack when the manual only defined repairs for 0.18 mm, someone needed to write the repair, justify it, substantiate it, sign their name under it. That someone was me, along with my wonderful teammates, with some of them becoming my friends, for life.</p> <p>Enter Shane Tucker, mentor, guide, and unexpected North Star. Together on late calls, I walked with Shane through each repair, each rationale, each decision. And at some point, I  noticed something new in his voice: certainty. Ownership. I wasn\u2019t guessing anymore. I could explain everything, every limit, every consideration, every step, and I understood why it mattered.</p> <p>I left those conversations feeling armored, carrying a toolbox of thinking I could apply anywhere.
